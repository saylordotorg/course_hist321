**Unit 11: New World Conflicts** <span id="11"></span> 
*Between the first voyages of the 1400s and the height of European
colonization in the eighteenth century, the New World was plagued by war
between European nations or between European forces and native peoples. 
European conflicts in the Americas were usually an extension of
conflicts centered in Europe.  The War of the Spanish Succession
(1701-1714), for example, embroiled European powers in a contest over
the issue of the inheritance of the Spanish crown and kingdom; it
resulted in raids and conflicts in the Caribbean, South America, and
North America.  On the other hand, violence between native peoples and
European colonizers usually erupted when colonists infringed on tribal
lands or disrupted local economies.  King Philip’s War (1675), one of
the bloodiest New World conflicts, pitted the Wampanoag Indians and
their allies against English colonists, resulting in thousands of
deaths.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider how inter-European conflicts often
migrated to New World settings.  We will also consider the uprisings
that broke out between land-hungry Europeans and the native
inhabitants.*
