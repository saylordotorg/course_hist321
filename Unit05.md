**Unit 5: England and France in North America** <span id="5"></span> 
*French and English adventurers arrived in the New World in the mid- to
late-1500s seeking wealth and new lands.  French exploration in the New
World began under the aegis of the French monarchy in the 1520s; the
monarch dispatched explorers to chart North America and the Caribbean
and to promote French interests there.  A number of short-lived French
settlements were founded in North and South America: Cap Rouge along the
St. Lawrence River, Fort Caroline in Florida, Fort Saint Louis in Texas,
and a Huguenot settlement in Brazil.  More permanent settlements did not
emerge in the Caribbean and along the St. Lawrence River until the
1600s.*  
         
 **The English began settling the Americas in the early 1600s; Queen
Elizabeth I was keen to claim land for England and to assert a
Protestant presence in the New World.  However, many of the early
settlements—Roanoke Colony (North Carolina) and Popham Colony
(Maine)—failed after a short time.  Competing with other European
powers, the English established permanent settlements along the North
American coast and in the Caribbean in the 1630s and 1640s**.  
         
 **In this unit, we will consider the many factors that imperiled early
French and English New World settlements: conflicts with local peoples,
disease, starvation, and internal strife.  We will also consider the
transition from trading posts and forts to permanent French and English
settlements.**
