This course will introduce you to a comparative history of New World
societies from 1400 to 1750. You will learn about European exploration
and colonization as well as the cultures of native peoples of the
Americas. The course will be structured geographically; each unit will
focus on a particular New World society during a specific time period.
Each unit will include representative primary-source documents that
illustrate important overarching political, economic, and social themes,
such as the fifteenth-century conceptualization of the “New World” and
colonization, the indigenous peoples living in the Americas at the time
of European contact, and the effect of New World societies on native
peoples and Africans. By the end of the course, you will understand how
the new communities in the New World evolved from fledgling settlements
into profitable European colonies and how New World societies—whether
French, Spanish, Portuguese, English, or indigenous—were highly varied
polities.

### Course Information

Welcome to HIST321. Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer: Christa Dierksheide and Mark Hoolihan**

**Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different,
free online resources. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   Yale University: Professor John Merriman Lecture Series via
    [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeGaZf3vAM0&feature=player_profilepage)or
    [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/european-civilization-1648/id341651047)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.

After working through each unit of the course, students must take the
Final Exam. Note that you will only receive an official grade on your
final exam. However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you
will need to work through the materials for each unit.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment:** This course will take you about **87.25 hours** to
complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should help you
plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take you 10 hours.  Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 (a total of 7 hours)
over the course of Monday through Wednesday. For example, you could
study the first page range for the reading in sub-subunit 1.1.1
(estimated at about 2.5 hours) on Monday, the second page range for the
sub-subunit 1.1.1 reading (estimated about 2.5 hours) on Tuesday, all
resources for sub-subunits 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 (estimated at 2 hours) on
Wednesday, etc.

**Tips/Suggestions:** Pay careful attention to major names and events in
each reading and/or lecture. Taking detailed notes as you work through
the materials in each unit and remembering these terms will help you
prepare for the Final Exam.
