**Unit 4: Spain and Portugal in America** <span id="4"></span> 
*Spain and Portugal were the first European powers to explore and settle
the New World.  The Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 split the Americas
into Spanish (western) and Portuguese (eastern) zones.*  
  
 *Spanish expansion into the New World began with the voyage of
Christopher Columbus in 1492, which was followed by the settlement
efforts of the conquistadors.  The Spanish crown sanctioned these
endeavors and hoped that gold, exotic produce, and the conversion of
native peoples to Christianity would result from exploration in the
Americas.  Spanish conquistadors founded several fledgling settlements
in the Caribbean and South America, but they were soon abandoned.  In
fact, Spanish dominance was not established in Central and South America
until the mid-1500s, when Spanish forces conquered the Aztec and Inca
empires.*  
  
 *The Portuguese founded trading posts in Newfoundland—for cod
fishing—and in Brazil—for logwood exports—in the early 1500s.  While the
Newfoundland settlement failed, the Portuguese settlement in Brazil did
begin to thrive by the 1530s.*  
         
 **In this unit, we will consider the monopoly that Spain and Portugal
had on New World possessions in the 1400s and early 1500s.  We will also
examine the many fledgling posts of these European powers in the
Americas, few of which developed into permanent settlements.**
