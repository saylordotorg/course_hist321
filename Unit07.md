**Unit 7: French New World Colonies** <span id="7"></span> 
*The French colonies in the New World were highly varied outposts.  The
North American holdings—called New France—were shaped mostly by the
lucrative fur trade.  New France was not populous, but it was
profitable, and fur trading became the center of the French North
American economy.  In addition, sugar plantations were established in
French Louisiana and African slaves were imported to work in the cane
fields or to be sold in ports along the Mississippi River.  Jesuit
missionaries had a prominent role in New France; they provided religious
services to French men and women and converted native peoples to
Catholicism.  The most valuable French holdings in the Americas,
however, were in the Caribbean. Saint-Domingue, nicknamed the “Pearl of
the Antilles,” became the most profitable plantation colony in the New
World.  France also claimed a number of other islands in the Caribbean,
including Guadeloupe and Martinique, and French Guiana in South America.
 Sugar and coffee drove the economies of these colonies, and, after
decimating the indigenous Arawak and Carib populations, French settlers
imported African slaves to labor on plantations.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider the differences between New France and
the French colonies in the Caribbean. We will also study French colonial
governance and economy and consider the impact of these policies on
native peoples.*
