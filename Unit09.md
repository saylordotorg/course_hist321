**Unit 9: The Spanish and Portuguese Americas** <span id="9"></span> 
*Spanish and Portuguese colonial forces dominated the New World during
much of the eighteenth century.  Portuguese Brazil produced gold, and,
by the mid-1700s, supplied 40 percent of Europe’s sugar.  And under the
Bourbon reforms of the eighteenth century, Spanish Central and South
America as well as Spanish territories in the Caribbean became more
efficient and centralized colonial outposts.*  
 *             
 Both Spanish and Portuguese New World colonies owed much of their
success to the streamlining of colonial administration and economy
during the 1700s.  Colonial authorities in most cases reported directly
to authorities in Europe; they had little or no autonomous rule.  Their
expansionist and exploitative mining and plantation regimes resulted in
the high production of gold, silver, sugar, and other products.  Of
course, the result was devastating for African slaves and indigenous
peoples, many of whom succumbed to disease or were enslaved or killed
during conflicts with Spanish and Portuguese forces.*  
 *             
 In this unit, we will consider the hegemony of the Spanish and
Portuguese in the New World during the eighteenth century.  We will also
study how this dominance came at a cost—the millions of Africans
enslaved in the New World and the countless deaths of native peoples
demonstrated the high price of colonization.*
