**Unit 8: British America** <span id="8"></span> 
*Although Britain was the last European power to establish a firm
presence in the New World, it exerted wide-ranging influence by the
eighteenth century.  First, British North American colonies were the
most populous.  Second, British traders imported more African slaves
than any other European nation.  And third, Britain maintained extensive
landholdings in North, Central, and South America as well as in the
Caribbean.*  
 *             
 British New World colonies were diverse.  North American colonies
supplied lumber, naval stores, and agricultural produce to the mother
country while the Caribbean colonies exported sugar and coffee.  After
devastating native peoples and deeming indentured servitude inadequate,
many Britons turned to African slaves as their main labor source.  And
unlike France, British colonies were not directly under the aegis of the
monarch; semi-autonomous legislative bodies governed British
provinces.*  
 *             
 In this unit, we will study the economies, labor systems, and cultures
of British North America, the British Caribbean, and British Central and
South America. *
