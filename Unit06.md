**Unit 6: European Empires, New World Colonies** <span id="6"></span> 
*By the mid-1600s, the New World had become critically important to many
European nations.  Portuguese, Spanish, English, and French powers had
founded permanent colonial settlements and established plantation
economies.  Inter-European political conflicts, religious wars between
Protestants and Catholics, European population pressures, and the
emergence of new “enlightened” ideas had fueled Europe’s new emphasis on
imperial aspirations.*  
         
 **In this unit, we will consider how pressures and conflicts in Europe
spurred European colonization of the New World in the 1600s and early
1700s.  We will also study how agricultural and industrial innovations
and new “enlightened” ideas undergirded Europe’s expansionist
ideology.**
