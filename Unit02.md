**Unit 2: Native Peoples of the Americas** <span id="2"></span> 
*When Christopher Columbus landed in the New World in 1492, he
mistakenly referred to the native inhabitants as “Indians,” thus
implying that all peoples in the Americas shared a common identity.  Of
course, this was not the case.  Between the fifteenth and eighteenth
century, “civilization” in the Americas was comprised of many diverse
societies that developed in isolation from the rest of the world.  Two
major centralized cultures emerged during this period: the Aztecan
Empire and the Incan Empire. However, hundreds of other sophisticated,
albeit diffuse, tribes lived in North America, South America, Central
America, and the Caribbean at this time.  The arrival of Europeans in
the 1400s disrupted these indigenous cultures through disease,
enslavement, and displacement.*  
    
 **In this unit, we will study the many major native peoples who
populated the Americas at the time of European contact.  We will also
study the impact of European cultures and policies on these tribes.**
