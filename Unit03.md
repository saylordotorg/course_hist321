**Unit 3: The European Age of Discovery** <span id="3"></span> 
*In the fifteenth century, powerful European monarchs launched the first
stage of global imperialism.  New developments in maritime technology
and a desire to expand the influence of Christianity motivated European
rulers to sponsor exploration and conquest in the New World.  In this
unit, we will see how the creation of new commercial and political
networks caused profound change: they introduced new peoples, ideas,
labor systems and cultures to Europeans while also wreaking havoc on
indigenous cultures of the New World.*
