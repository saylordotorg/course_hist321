**Unit 1: What Was the “New World”?** <span id="1"></span> 
*In the fifteenth century, the “New World” referred to the Americas.
 When Columbus returned to Spain after his journey across the Atlantic
Ocean, he was widely heralded as the discoverer of the “New World.”  Of
course, the western hemisphere was only “new” to the Europeans.
 Indigenous peoples had lived in North and South America for centuries,
developing unique and varied cultures, societies, and civilizations
there.*  
 *             
 In this unit, we will examine how people defined the “New World” and
why they considered it different from the “Old World.”  We will also
consider the many different peoples who populated and exploited the
Americas: merchants, native peoples, settlers, and slaves.*

    Book.”  Read pages 1-49 and 55-186.  In this 1530 text, Peter
    Martyr, a Spanish historian, recounts the discovery and early
    exploration of the Americas.  Martyr was one of the first observers
    to coin the term “novi orbis,” meaning “New World” in Latin.  Martyr
    composed his piece with the aid of information supplied by
    Christopher Columbus and the reports of the Council of the Indies
    (the administrative body that oversaw Spanish colonial endeavors).

     Instructions: Please read the text and view the images of early
    mapping of the New World linked above and think about the following
    questions: What landmasses and other geographical and topographical
    features are included in the maps?  What consistencies exist among
    the maps?  What differences exist?  Collectively, what do these maps
    reveal about what explorers “discovered?”  What did explorers
    miss?  
      
     Reading and viewing these images should take you approximately 15
    minutes.
