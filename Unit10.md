**Unit 10: Africans in the New World** <span id="10"></span> 
*Beginning in the Sixteenth century, Africans were brought to the
Americans to serve as enslaved laborers on plantations and in mines. 
However, Africans were not the first laborers to be used in the New
World for that purpose.  Portuguese and Spanish colonizers had utilized
indentured servitude and enslaved local Amerindian peoples.  However,
when disease depleted the Amerindian slaves and indentured European
servants, African laborers became a viable alternative.  Africans were
accustomed to a tropical climate, were familiar with agricultural
production, and seemed resistant to French West Indies, or to Spanish or
Portuguese America as captive slaves.  
  
 Although African laborers were used throughout the Caribbean, mainland
North American and Central and South America, the nature of enslavement
and the role of African laborers in each society varied widely.  There
were many reasons for this.  First, the nature of slavery depended upon
the goods being produced - slavery on sugar plantations in Barbados, for
example, was far different than slavery in the gold mines of Peru. 
Second, New World societies often perceived slavery (and slaves)
differently.  In some colonies, for example, manumission (release from
slavery) was more common and accepted than in others.  And third, many
New World societies were shaped by their importation of slaves from
specific regions in Africa.  Rice planters in the Carolinas, for
example, wanted to import African ethnic groups who had experience
growing rice in Africa.  
  
 In this unit, we will examine why European colonizers turned to
imported Africans as their main source of labor on plantations and in
gold and silver mines.  We will also compare and contrast the slave
societies that emerged in the New World between the sixteenth and
eighteenth centuries.*
